# Overview
This repo is intended for hosting open-source models for general and benchmarking use. All models are presented in the `tensorflow.keras` API and intended to run in TensorFlow

## Model Genealogy
There are three main categories of genealogy:

* Models generated from scratch by SiLabs ML R&D
* Models derived from common open-source/public architectures such as MobileNets, ResNets 
* Open-source models which have been ported from either textual or non-standard formats into a `tensorflow.keras` representation

## Directory Structure & Licenses
Due to the diversity in genealogy of models, each model is placed in a separate directory with its appropriate `LICENSE.md` file. It is the intent that all models are derived from and/or released as non-viral licenses such as MIT or Apache 2.0
